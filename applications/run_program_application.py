"""
Run a command or script on the Instance. The command or script should be
given as a path, if the path is relative, it is interpreted relative to the
Testbed Package's root. 

The setting value "command" contains that path alongside with additional arguments.
It is possible to use expressions like '/bin/bash <script>'. The script or program
should be executable. "environment" contains a key-value-dictionary that is passed
as environment variables to the command or script. The script or command is 
always terminated when the "timeout" is exceeded, the "ignore_timeout" setting can
be used to define if that should be interpreted as a failure of this Application 
and defaults to "false". Settings "environment" and "ignore_timeout" are optional.

Example config:
    {
        "application": "run-program",
        "name": "run-my-script",
        "delay": 0,
        "runtime": 60,
        "settings": {
            "command": "my-instance/run-script.sh", // in this case: relative to Testbed Package
            "environment": {
                "KEY": "VALUE",
                "REPEAT": "10"
            }
            "ignore_timeout": true // Timeout is not treated as a failure
        }
